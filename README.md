# SnaKt Design Docs

This is a collection of design documents made during the
SnaKt project.  Many of these are from the early days, and
do not represent the project in its current state.

A more structured description is included in Francesco
Protopapa's master thesis [Verifying Kotlin Code with Viper
by Controlling Aliasing][1].

## Main repository

The actual code is in the [jesyspa/Kotlin repository on
GitHub][0].

## Contact

The main point of contact for the project is Komi Golov
(komi.golov@jetbrains.com).
