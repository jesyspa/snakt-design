// this is NOT meant to be treated as a regular abstract function, but rather
// as the contract for a function. We have plans to change the syntax for this.
// In order to call a function f that matches this description, we need to (1) pass
// the ownership of the captured state, (2) show that the precondition 'pre' holds,
// (3) show that the function 'post' is compatible with the 'postSpec' call descriptor.
// Because 'pre' is a bool value, we are not able to pass permissions into f except
// for the perms to the captured state, but we can probably enrich the contract to be
// able to do that. The 'post' func related the old value of the captured state with
// the new. To avoid further complications with permissions, I made it so that it compares
// only the abstract view of the state, not its actual concrete values. We can probably
// enrich the specs for maximum expressibility here too.
// Finally, there are two parameters here for technical reasons: an instance of the
// CapturedState interface, which determines how to interpret the captured state,
// and 'v', which is the actual captured state.
